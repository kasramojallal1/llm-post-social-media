    "body": "As ML researchers, we must prioritize LLM security to address vulnerabilities that could be exploited in real-world applications. Recent advancements, such as the MCP-AttackBench, provide a comprehensive benchmark for simulating diverse attack vectors (https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10991). Additionally, techniques like format-preserving encryption and metric differential privacy are essential for safeguarding sensitive data processed by LLMs (https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05147). By integrating these methods, we can enhance the robustness of our models and mitigate risks associated with AI usage.",
